# OVERVIEW


X-Update Manager (Configuration Manager) provides a set of tools (and access to resources) that can help manage the complex task of (tracking and) applying software updates to Web Applications. 
An effective software update management process is necessary to maintain operational efficiency, overcome security issues, and maintain the stability of the platform installed. 
However, because of the changing nature of technology and the the ongoing improvement of products, services or processes through incremental and breakthrough improvements, effective software update management requires consistent and continual attention.
