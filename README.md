# X-Update Update Manager Dashboard

**X-update Manager** features a user-friendly GUI to manage updates from a single dashboard.  
You can quickly install and update XCL itself, modules and themes without any FTP client.

With the introduction of X-update, site administrators just need to log-in to the administration  
dashboard to complete the installation or update of XCL, modules, themes, libraries and preloads.  
X-Update will deploy updates from distribution sites such as GitHub or GitLab repositories.  
X-update also supports the installation and update of D3 modules (duplicate and directory free).
  
## Features 

* Compatible modules and themes can be installed without a FTP client software.
* The latest versions of supported modules and themes can be downloaded from each public server
* User-friendly unzip, extract, and upload from X-Update Dashboard administration screen
* Simple installation wizard to perform a normal module or theme installation.
* Other extensions, ie. preloads, can be downloaded and uploaded from the store site.
